V.0.5.3
This update has been a too long a time coming. A lot of background stuff has been updated,
such as readability within the bot's code. A few additional changes have been made,
listed here. There will likely be more bugfixes over time, as there is only so much I
can test on my own.
-Leaderboard now utilises JSON file to store scores.
-leaderboard command renamed to highscore
-Scores on leaderboard have been reset. Say goodbye to your great fortunes.
-Christmas bot theme removed (part of an invisible update)
-Bot activity updated.
-Crate message now updates when the crate is claimed.
The actual adventurey part of the Adventure Update (V0.5) is still in the tool shop, but
now that I can read my own code again, and I've discovered the wonders of JSON, it may be
returning soon.
